# Simple To-Do List App
A command-line to-do list app built with Python to manage tasks with priorities.

## Features
- Add tasks with priorities (High/Medium/Low, enter H/M/L)
- Cancel adding or deleting tasks with 'x' or Enter
- View tasks with priorities, pauses until Enter is pressed
- Delete tasks (displays tasks without pause)
- Save tasks to `tasks.txt` for persistence

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/Azzbo77/python-learning.git`
3. Navigate to the folder: `cd todo-app`
4. Run: `python todo.py`

## Future Improvements
- Add due dates to tasks (e.g., "2025-06-02")
- Sort tasks by priority (High > Medium > Low)
- Allow editing task descriptions or priorities
- Add task categories (e.g., Work, Personal)
